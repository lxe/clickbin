========

Clickb.in is a simple service to share and store collections of bookmarks. 

Let's say you're researching a topic in a library, and you need to bookmark something. Just add "clickb.in" before the URL, and clickb.in will create a new 'bin' with a random name that you can add more links as you progress with your research. You then head back home, open up your web browser and navigate to yourbin.clickb.in and all your links are automagically there.

Clickb.in supports private bins as well.
